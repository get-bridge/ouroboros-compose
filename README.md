Ouroboros (for Compose)
=======================

Ouroboros is a simplistic unidirectional dataflow library for Android Jetpack Compose. It is based on Kotlin and coroutines and inspired by React, Redux and Spotify's Mobius. It strives to be simplistic, easy to understand and testable.

Public documentation is in the works but in the meantime take a look at the example application included under `example-app`.
